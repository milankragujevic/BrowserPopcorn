## Where's the API?
Unfortunatelly, the API is currently closed source, not because I'm doing something evil, but simply because I haven't had the time for a proper security audit and wouldn't like somebody hacking my server. 
I need to keep the security on the servers tight so that the identities of the users and the servers' locations are protected.

MPAA and other evil entities, the popcorncdn.ga server is just a proxy, don't bother taking it down, I'll get a new one in hours. The real servers are well hidden and will remain so.

Any API version published in the future will be stripped down of identifiable information.
